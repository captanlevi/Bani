It is important to show your child that you will support his/her access with your ex-spouse. Parents can seek counselling and emotional support during difficult times for themselves or their child.
My ex-spouse and I have agreed on remote access to protect our child and families from possible infection. How do I conduct remote access for my child?,"You can facilitate remote access through telephone, video calls or other available online platforms that you and your ex-spouse agree on. The parent with care and control of the child (care parent) will need to assist the child by setting up the session and encouraging the children to participate in the remote session with the access parent. Care parents are advised to provide some space for the child to interact independently with the access parent. For a younger child, aged 5 years old and below, the care parent may need to be physically around to assist the child but should allow the child to interact with the access parent without disruptions. Parents having access may find creative ways to connect with the child e.g. use online games. To complement remote access, parents may also encourage their child to send emails, letters or cards to access parents in order to stay in touch. The children may send appropriate pictures or videos of themselves to the access parent as well. The duration of the remote sessions will depend on the attention span and developmental stage of the child."

Grandparents can continue to care for their grandchildren if the grandchildren stay with them throughout this period. We strongly urge seniors to stay at home and avoid going out. You should not drop off your children with their grandparents on a daily basis as this increases the risk of transmission. However, exemptions can be made if you belong to one of the following groups: Both parents are essential service workers and unable to work from home; One parent is a healthcare professional (e.g. doctor, nurse, allied health professional, support care staff) and is unable to work from home; and One parent is an essential service worker who is unable to work from home, and have a child/children below the age of three. Individuals can still visit elderly family members to assist with their daily needs if there is no one else living with them who can do so. Where possible, we strongly recommend for family members to support their elderly relatives who do not stay with them by keeping in contact through phone or video calls, or bringing them groceries, food and other essential supplies to assist with their daily needs. This is to avoid seniors having to make trips out of the home for such activities. Social gatherings, such as private parties and social get-togethers with friends and relatives and family members not within the same household, are disallowed."
"Can children still visit playgrounds or play in common areas such as HDB corridors, or condominium facilities?","No. Public playgrounds and condominium facilities, such as playgrounds, gyms and pools, will be closed. Children should also refrain from playing in common areas such as HDB corridors and void decks. Children may visit public spaces around their immediate neighbourhood, for example public parks. They should do so only with members of their households. Safe distancing measures must be observed at all times. Members of public are also advised to return to their homes promptly and not linger."
Can I move to stay in another household (e.g. my fiancé/fiancée or my child/ parent) in the middle of this circuit breaker period (e.g. on 15 April 2020) and remain in that household till the end of the circuit breaker period (i.e. 1 June 2020)?,"You should avoid doing so, to minimize the risk of transmission due to frequent interactions between households."
Can my day-time nanny caring for my child still come?,"No. Parents should suspend services of their day-time nannies so as to minimise the risk of transmission across different households. Parents are encouraged to care for their children within their own households. Employers are requested to exercise the necessary flexibility to support parents who are working from home during this time as having to care for their children personally might take a toll on their work productivity. To support our essential service workers we are allowing exemptions from the restriction for the following families who can continue to tap on the grandparents for childcare support on a daily basis: Both parents are essential service workers and unable to work from home. One parent is a healthcare professional (e.g. doctor, nurse, allied health professional , support care staff, etc) and is unable to work from from home. One parent is an essential service worker who is unable to work from home and have a child/children below the age of three (this is in recognition that younger children are typically taken care of at home and need more attention). Preschools will also continue to prioritise limited service provision for families without alternative care where: Both parents are essential service workers (non-healthcare workers) or One parent is a healthcare professional."
I find it difficult to work from home and take care of my child at the same time. I am also unable to find alternative child care arrangements. What can I do?,"The circuit breaker is an important public health measure to stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus and to safeguard the health all Singaporeans during this pandemic. It is in the best interest of your children and family to stay at home during this period. For parents working from home, we fully empathise that it can be challenging to juggle caring for our loved ones and maintaining the fullest commitment to our work. However, these are exceptional times and we each need to make adjustments to our lives to collectively curb the transmission of COVID-19. We need to limit the attendance in schools/preschools to reduce the risks of transmission. Employers are encouraged to exercise flexibility and understanding to employees during this period."
I'm a parent working in essential services. Can I continue to send my child to preschool?,"During the circuit breaker period, preschools remain open to serve a limited group of families. They remain open for families with no alternative caregiving arrangements and where (a) both parents are essential service workers (non-healthcare workers) working away from home or (b) one parent is a healthcare worker working away from home. Parents may contact their existing preschool if the child is already enrolled with a centre. If your child is not enrolled with a centre. If your child is not enrolled with a centre. If your child is not enrolled with a preschool, you can find one using ECDA's Preschool Search Portal (http://go.gov.sg/ecda-psp) and contact the centre directly."
I'm a parent working in essential services. Can my child continue attending a community-based student care centre?,"For parents who are both working in essential services (non-healthcare workers) and are unable to secure alternative care arrangements, you may approach your child's school or Special Education (SPED) school for assistance."
"Is my job considered ""essential services""?",You may refer to the list of essential services listed here: https://go.gov.sg/essential-services
My parents usually come over to help me with caring for my children on weekdays. Can we still do so?,"You should avoid doing so during this period, to minimise the risk of transmission, especially to elderly parents, due to frequent interactions between households. Grandparents can continue to care for their grandchildren if the grandchildren stay with them throughout this period. They must remain in the same household throughout the period, as movement between households should be avoided to reduce the risk of transmission and to protect our seniors who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. While most parents would be working from home, there would be some households where parents have to continue going to work during this period. These are workers in our essential services, especially our healthcare workers who are on the frontline working on shifts and on weekends, when childcare centres may not be available, and may be activated at any time of the day to respond to the COVID-19 situation. They will face additional difficulties which may be unnecessarily stressful for these essential service personnel. For very young children, we also recognise that it is difficult for them to be away from their parents for long periods of time, and adjusting to new caregivers that they are unfamiliar with would be challenging. Therefore, we will be implementing exemptions for the following families, who may continue to tap on the grandparents for childcare support on a daily basis: Both parents are essential service workers and unable to work from home; One parent is a healthcare professional (e.g. doctor, nurse, allied health professional, support care staff) and is unable to work from home; and One parent is an essential service worker who is unable to work from home, and have a child/children below the age of three. Parents requiring assistance may contact ECDA at contact@ecda.gov.sg or 67359213. Families who are relying on the grandparents for childcare on a daily basis are advised to take the necessary safe distancing precautions to protect the elderly. Observe personal hygiene and try to reduce interaction time as far as possible when visiting their home. Do not visit when unwell."
What supporting documents do I need to prove to my child's preschool/student care centre that I am working in essential services?,"Parents/guardians can provide carious forms of documentation, for example, a letter from your employer, your staff pass etc."
"Will parents working in essential services, who continue sending their children to preschool and student care centres, receive the 50% fee offset as well?",The fee offsets are only extended to Singaporean children not attending preschool and student care during the circuit breaker period.
I am experiencing high levels of stress during this circuit breaker period. Where can I seek help or respite?,"For those with general anxiety or stress, you may call the National CARE Hotline (Tel: 62026868) for support. For those experiencing marital or parenting stress, you may wish to contact CPH Online Counselling at www.cphonlinecounselling.sg. Live chat: Mon-Fri 9am-9pm From 13 Apr 2020, Sat 10am-2pm (except public holidays) Email: Anytime, counsellor will respond within 3 working days"
I suspect a child is being abused. How do I contact Child Protection?,"If you suspect that a child is abused in any way, please do not hesitate to contact one of the following to seek advice or help: Child Protection Service Helpline (1800 777 0000) HEART @ Fei Yue Child Protection Specialist Centre (6819 9170) Big Love Child Protection Specialist Centre (6445 0400) SAFE SPACE Child Protection Specialist Centre (6266 0171) If there is an emergency where a child has been harmed or is in imminent danger, please call the Police at 999 immediately."
"Will all MSF services, programmes and facilities open in Phase 1?","MSF’s public services that were available during the circuit breaker (including our Social Service Offices (SSOs), Registry of Marriages) will continue with safe management measures in place. Come 2 June, we will reopen MSF-funded social services and programmes (including Family Service Centres, Day Activity Centres for persons with disabilities, Special Student Care Centres) safely in phases. In Phase 1, we will prioritise the reopening of critical services and those addressing higher needs. Safe management measures will be in place to safeguard the health and safety of all staff and clients, in particular for services delivered in the Centres, or through home visits."
How is MSF safeguarding the health and safety of people who turn up at Social Service Offices and other frontline services?,"MSF-funded services and Centres are required to put in place safe management measures to ensure: i.Individuals who may pose a risk of transmission are not allowed into the premises ii.Minimal interaction/mixing between staff and clients from different zones/teams, so as to minimise risk of cross-transmission in the event of a confirmed COVID-19 case in Centres iii.Staff and clients adopt safe behaviour to reduce the risk of transmission and ensure a safe environment within Centres. Some of these measures include temperature screening and health checks for all staff, clients and visitors arriving at the Centre, stepping up disinfection of frequently touched surfaces and spacing out the seats in interview rooms and service counters in Centres at least one metre apart. As an added precaution for service counters, desk shields or plastic dividers will be used to keep our clients and staff safe. Group work/activities will also be suspended until further notice to limit social mixing across different households."
Will more Social Service Agencies (SSA) volunteers be allowed to operate and interact with vulnerable families during Phase 1 post-circuit breaker?,"Volunteers may be required to support Social Service Agencies (SSAs) in service provision. Activities involving regular volunteers who perform essential and routine functions can continue. They should be regarded and managed as staff with the necessary precautions taken. Activities involving ad-hoc volunteers who perform non-essential functions, or who might be in close contact with vulnerable groups, should be suspended. To protect the more vulnerable elderly residents, we will continue to disallow volunteers from entering Homes serving elderly residents."
It was previously announced that staff serving elderly residents in Homes will move on-site or to hotels during the circuit breaker period. Will staff serving elderly residents continue to stay onsite/hotels after the circuit breaker lifts?,"From 2 June, most of the staff will return to their own places of residence. Some staff require time to make adjustments to their living arrangements to minimise the risk of cross-infections, such as those who share accommodation with other individuals serving in other elderly homes.These staff may continue staying onsite at the Homes or in hotels for a few more weeks while they secure new living arrangements. As all our staff working at these Homes continue to be in regular close contact with residents, they should refrain from going out, except for essential needs."
Can all Social Service Agencies (SSAs) resume services in Phase 1 following the circuit breaker?,"From 2 June 2020, Social Service Agencies (SSAs) can only serve high-needs clients and provide critical services with minimal staff onsite with safe management measures in place. If urgent/critical face-to-face contact is needed, shorter interaction times with safe distancing measures should be observed. SSAs and community groups distributing essential aid (e.g. cooked food and urgent financial aid) to vulnerable persons and families may continue their activities. However, to avoid a resurgence of community cases, SSAs and community groups providing aid are strongly encouraged to limit their activities to cases in need of urgent aid and essential supplies, and to take necessary precautions."
What criteria do SSAs and community groups have to fulfil for their services or activities to be considered ‘urgent aid and essential supplies’?,"Essential aid refers to supplies necessary for daily sustenance, such as cooked food, food rations, and urgent financial aid. SSAs must be serving an essential and urgent need that is not already being met, and comply with the precautionary measures detailed in our advisory before NCSS can consider approving their activities. NCSS will also take into consideration the geographical distribution of SSAs and their beneficiaries, to ensure that the delivery of essential aid is coordinated and the vulnerable are adequately served. Groups also need to demonstrate strict safe distancing measures in their plans (e.g. no social mixing among different groups of staff/volunteers, reduced number of people and duration of physical interactions with beneficiaries). Details can be found in the 26 May advisory on essential aid distribution."
"If my SSA was previously whitelisted to provide essential aid, do I need to go back to NCSS to seek approval on my distribution plans to continue operations?","Yes, agencies previously whitelisted should continue to seek NCSS’ approval during Phase 1, as distribution plans would likely be different from what was approved during the circuit breaker (e.g. dates, frequency, service users, volunteers)."
How long will the consideration/review process take for services/activities to be approved?,SSAs and groups distributing essential aid that need to engage in face-to-face intervention for urgent or at-risk cases should plan the modality of essential aid distribution to adhere with strict safe management measures. These plans should be submitted to NCSS at www.go.gov.sg/distributioncontact at least 3 working days before SSAs/ community groups commence planning and/or conducting any distribution activities. NCSS will respond within 3 working days.
What happens if SSAs and community groups do not comply with the advisory and continue their activities without seeking NCSS’ approval?,"The precautionary measures are in place to stem community transmission of COVID-19 by resuming activities in a gradual and safe manner. We ask for the understanding and support of all SSAs to comply during this period, and approach NCSS for approval before continuing with their essential aid activities. Through everyone’s cooperation, we will be able to ensure that essential aid continues to be provided to the vulnerable in a safe manner."
Will social enterprises and ground-up groups be allowed to operate?,"Social enterprises and registered ground-up groups should ensure that they are exempted by MTI to resume onsite operations. In addition, they need to seek approval from NCSS to carry out essential aid distribution."
How will NCSS help organisations to refine their plans before getting approval? What further help do they need even after they have declared they are able to comply with the precautionary measures?,"NCSS will work closely with SSAs and community groups to optimise their operations so that they can continue to deliver essential aid to those in need, in a way that ensures the safety of beneficiaries, staff and volunteers. SSAs and community groups will be required to comply with precautionary and safe management measures."
"If I previously received a time-limited permit, do I have a higher chance of getting NCSS’ approval for my new distribution plans?","Agencies previously whitelisted or received time-limited permit should continue to seek NCSS’ approval during Phase 1, as distribution plans would likely be different from what was approved during the circuit breaker (e.g. dates, frequency, service users, volunteers etc)."
"A limited number of selected senior care centres, day rehab centres, psychiatric rehabilitation centres, and day hospices will remain open to support those with inadequate family support, as well as intensive care needs. How do I ask for permission to continue sending my family members to these centres?",Please ask your existing centre-based care provider to make an application on your behalf to the Agency of Integrated Care (AIC).
Can I still accompany my elderly parent living in a different household to medical appointments or to purchase essential supplies?,"Yes, you can continue to accompany your elderly parent to medical appointments if there are no other alternatives (such as deferring non-essential appointments) but please take additional precautions such as wearing a mask and ensuring good personal hygiene while you are in contact with him or her. As for purchase of essential supplies, we strongly recommend for family members to support their elderly relatives who do not stay with them by bringing them groceries, food and daily necessities. This is to avoid seniors having to make trips out of the home for such activities. Seniors should stay at home as far as possible."
"Can I still check on my neighbour who is a senior? She is living alone with no kin, and usually comes to our house for dinner.","Yes, you may continue to provide assistance to her for her daily needs, but unless absolutely necessary, this should not be done with physical interaction. If you have any physical interaction, please take the necessary safe distancing precautions, such as observing personal hygiene and ensuring your hands are clean, minimising physical contact and maintaining a safe separation as much as possible. Do not visit if you are unwell. If you know of a senior e.g. neighbour, friend, family member, who needs assistance with their daily needs, please contact the AIC hotline at 1800-650-6060."
Home personal care will be scaled down to serve only seniors with inadequate family support. How do I apply for continuation of service for these seniors?,"Home personal care will be available for seniors who live alone, or seniors who live only with another frail person or person with disability, or if the senior’s only caregiver is an essential service worker. If you know of seniors in such a situation you may apply for continuation of service through the senior’s existing home personal care provider, or call the AIC hotline at 1800-650-6060."
"If I am a volunteer delivering food to seniors and vulnerable groups, am I allowed to continue? If I stop, who will take care of these vulnerable persons?","It is far preferable to stop this at an individual level, as you will be coming into contact with other people, and then with the seniors and vulnerable persons. However, organisations and groups distributing essential aid (e.g. food) to vulnerable persons and families are allowed to continue their activities, but these should be limited to critical aid and supplies, and the necessary precautions must be taken. MSF’s advisory on Essential Aid Distribution (8 Apr 2020) provides more details (available at www.msf.gov.sg/media-room/Pages/COVID-19-advisory.aspx). Please check with your host organisation whether it has been pre-cleared to continue with its activities. Per MSF’s advisory, if you are an organisation or group seeking to provide such services, please submit the necessary information to the National Council of Social Services (NCSS). MOH-subvented providers for meal deliveries do not need to submit additional information to NCSS. For persons who are unable to buy or prepare food on their own, please contact the AIC Hotline at 1800-650-6060 for referral to a meal delivery service. All other organisations/ groups providing aid are encouraged to engage known aid recipients remotely (via telephone, online, video-conference). This includes befriending services to check on the well-being of the elderly."
"My parent lives alone but does not require assistance with daily needs. However, I am afraid that he/she will get lonely as he/she is unable to spend time with friends at the coffeeshop/ community centre/ Senior Activity Centre during this period. Can I visit him/her from time-to-time?","To protect our seniors, we should minimise face-to-face interaction where possible. You may wish to contact him/her via the phone or video call instead, and encourage him/her to stay active by doing exercises at home, some of which can be accessed via the TV and online programmes which have been put in place for seniors. You can also check in on him/her when you help to bring over groceries, food and daily necessities, but try to reduce interaction time as far as possible. Please take the necessary safe distancing precautions while you are there, such as observing personal hygiene and ensuring your hands are clean, minimising physical contact and maintaining a safe separation as much as possible. Do not visit if you are unwell. We understand that this is a difficult adjustment for many families, and these measures go against our instinct to want to demonstrate frequent care and attention to our loved ones. But the elderly and vulnerable are most susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection, and we should refrain from exposing them to the risk of COVID-19 as far as possible by minimising physical interactions with them."
What should I do if I am experiencing high levels of stress as a caregiver of a senior during this period?,Please contact the AIC hotline at 1800-650-6060.
Will the Government be doing anything to reach out and identify seniors in need during this period? How will this be done?,"Yes, should you know of any senior requiring assistance with their daily needs, please contact the AIC hotline at 1800-650-6060."
"Am I allowed to make use of the hotel facilities (e.g. gym, swimming pool) during the SHN period?","For the safety of those around you, you are required to stay in your room at all times during the 14-day SHN period. Usage of hotel facilities are not allowed. WIFI will be available, and meals will be catered for you. Free laundry services will also be provided."
Am I under quarantine orders?,"No, you are not under quarantine orders and are not required to have a dedicated room and toilet if this is not feasible. However, you should remain in your place of residence at all times during the 14-day period."
Are meals and laundry provided as part of the stay at SHN designated facilities?,"Returnees at the SHN designated facilities will have their own room/ toilet, and will be provided all their meals, so that they may avoid physical contact with other individuals. There will be WIFI provided so that you can continue your studies or work, or stay in touch with your family. Free laundry services are also provided."

Can I leave Singapore for work reasons or any other reasons during SHN period?,PSHN should defer their travel plans until completion of entire 14-day duration of SHN.
Can i opt into SHN dedicated hotels if I am already in Singapore and serving my SHN? Why are US/UK returnees who arrived prior to 25 Mar 2359H allowed to opt into SHN dedicated hotels?,"Returnees who are currently in Singapore serving out their SHN should continue to do so at their place of residence, including hotels. This is to manage the limited capacity and prioritise fresh returnees. Given that UK/US returnees accounted for the highest share of imported cases thus far, we had previously allowed UK/US returnees who arrived in Singapore prior to 25 Mar 2359H to switch to our dedicated facilities. For further assistance, please submit your request at www.go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds."
Can I send my employees/students/myself to the doctor to get tested at the end of the 14-day period so that they can be cleared to come back to work/return to school?,"It is not useful to send persons who do not have symptoms to the doctor/ hospital for testing. Such individuals will not be offered diagnostic testing, and will be asked to return home."
Can I shift locations during SHN?,"You are urged to serve your 14-day SHN notice at the same location to minimize social contact and exposure. If you have no other options and are required to move, we will assist to escalate to the relevant authorities (PA) to consider your request. You are to inform of the reason you need to move, where you are currently at, where and when you will be moving and how you will move there. For PSHN+ with extenuating circumstances and require moving, please provide the details via the online form at www.go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds. You may also contact 6812 5555 for more information."
Can I visit my preferred clinic or TCM Clinic instead?,"As part of socially responsibility, we recommend for PSHNs to go to the nearest available PHPC to minimise the contact with the general public."
Can my family members continue to stay with me during the time I serve SHN? Are they at risk of infection?,"Your family members may continue to live with you. However, you and your family should continue to monitor your health and observe good personal hygiene practices. Do not share food, crockery, utensils and other personal hygiene items. If you become unwell, avoid contact with your family members and seek medical attention immediately."
Do I need to declare to my employers/schools that I am on SHN?,"Persons who have returned from the affected areas are advised to inform their employers or schools that they are on SHN. This is so that your employer or school can provide the necessary assistance to facilitate your SHN. For persons with pre-scheduled appointments, they are also urged to contact the clinic and inform of their SHN status to confirm that the clinic will see them on the scheduled date/time before contacting PA. They should also defer all non-essential medical appointment after their SHN period."
Do I need to make a booking for rooms at SHN designated facilities beforehand?,"No, SHN designated facilities will be assigned to returnees from the US and UK upon their arrival in Singapore. There will be no booking required."
"During my stay in the facilities, who can assist me in areas of food, medical supplies, childcare help etc?","Persons staying at the designated SHN facilities must not leave their designated location for any reason. Should they require assistance for daily needs, such as the purchase of groceries, they should make arrangements with their relatives/friends. Those who require further assistance can submit a request at www.go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds."
"Given that SHN is only a notice, what will happen if I don’t comply with the guidelines stated?","You are required to comply with the requirements as detailed in the SHN. You are strongly advised to comply as a precautionary measure to prevent transmission of disease in your workplace, place of education, or to members of public. The Government of Singapore will conduct checks to ensure that you comply with the SHN. If you violate the SHN, you may face the following penalties, as you have put the well-being of the wider community at risk: If you fail to comply with the SHN, you may be prosecuted under Section 21A of the Infectious Diseases Act; you are a Singapore Permanent Resident, Long-Term Visit Pass holder, Dependant’s Pass holder or Student’s Pass holder, your Re-Entry Permit or passes may be revoked or the validity shortened and you may be barred from entering Singapore for a specified period of time; If you are a foreign employee (including foreign domestic workers) issued with a work pass, your work pass may be revoked.

For foreign students, this may include the cancellation of your child/ward’s Student’s Pass or Dependant’s Pass."
How long is the Government providing these designated facilities?,We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. We will stand down these facilities when the importation risk has been addressed.
How many facilities have been activated? what is the total capacity? How many Singaporeans/PRs do we expect to have to put up?,"We have sufficient rooms to accommodate all returning Singaporeans who have to serve their 14-day SHN in dedicated facilities.

How will my family members be informed on my assigned designated facilities?,Persons on SHN are responsible for informing their family members of their assigned SHN dedicated facility.
I am placed on Stay-Home-Notice. What should I do if the link in the SMS is not working?,"If you are unable to access the link in the SMS, you can email ICA to inform them at ICA_SHNQ@ica.gov.sg. Please provide your full name, identification number (NRIC/FIN) and details of your phone, such as brand and model. In the meantime, you may receive a phone call / house visit to verify your location. You will then need to explain to the officer that you did not receive the SMS and follow any instructions given by the officer to verify your location. Please note that ICA officers will not ask for any financial information or request for money over the phone.

Those returning with pets should make their own arrangements for pet accommodation for 14 days (e.g. cared by family and friends). However, those who have extenuating circumstances that require them to be with their pet (e.g. pet is an emotional support animal) may submit a request through www.go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds."
I have a pre-arranged medical appointment (e.g. surgery / eye specialist / chemotherapy / kidney dialysis treatment) during my SHN period. What should I do?,"You are urged to call your clinic and declare that you are under SHN and check if the clinic will continue to see you during the pre-arranged appointment. Wherever possible, we urge you to defer non-emergency appointment to after your SHN.

"I have pre-booked a hotel to serve out my SHN prior to this announcement. Can I stay in my original hotel? If the hotel does not waive cancellation fees, will the Government provide reimbursement?","It is mandatory for all returnees (whether SC/PR/LTP holders) to serve their SHN in designated facilities. Those who have arranged to serve out their SHN at other accommodation should inform their accommodation provider accordingly.

What is Singapore's poverty line?,"While Singapore does not have a national poverty line, we take an approach of tailoring our social safety net to different groups, depending on their needs and circumstances. We believe that this approach is more flexible and no less effective than countries that choose to adopt a poverty line. We use broad definitions for the groups we seek to help, have clear criteria to identify and assess those in need, and tailor schemes to assist them. Our assessment process is rigorous but also flexible to cater to the genuinely needy. Singaporeans who do not meet the scheme criteria but who still deserve help, can receive assistance. There will always be a segment of our society who are vulnerable, and despite their best efforts, need help to cope. The Government is committed to do more to help them. We will continue to review our assistance schemes regularly so that they remain relevant. We will also continue to develop different indicators to improve our understanding of the numbers and needs of low income families in Singapore. The Government cannot do this alone. We will work with community organisations and kind-hearted Singaporeans who have been playing a crucial role in helping the needy in Singapore."
